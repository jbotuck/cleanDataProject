ACTIVITY
	what the subject was doing at the time of the measurements
SUBJECT
	Number for the person that was doing the activity
Remainining variables are average values per subject per activity across multiple time windows. 
Therefore mean is an average of means and std is an average of standard deviations.
see "UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt" for information about the individual features. The variable names are almost entirely the same except that the '(' have been replaced by '.'
