cleanDataProject
================
The script works assuming the dataset has been unzipped into the current working directory as done in the repo
It saves the new tidy data set as a txt file titled "tidySet.txt"
It requires the plyr package
Only features that included the terms "mean()" or "std()" were included
this way every mean has an std
